<!-- 
    The focus events fire when an element receives or loses focus. These are the two main focus events:

    focus fires when an element has received focus.
    blur fires when an element has lost focus.

    The focusin and focusout fire at the same time as focus and blur, however, they bubble while the focus and blur do not.

    The following elements are focusable:

    The window gains focus when you bring it forward by using Alt+Tab or clicking on it and loses focus when you send it back.
    Links when you use a mouse or a keyboard.
    Form fields like input text when you use a keyboard or a mouse.
    Elements with tabindex, also when you use a keyboard or a mouse
